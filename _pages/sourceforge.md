**Sourcefirge** is web-based service that offers software developers a centralized online location to control and manage free and open-source software projects. It provides a source code repository, bug tracking, mirroring of downloads for load balancing, a wiki for documentation, developer and user mailing lists, user-support forums, user-written reviews and ratings, a news bulletin, micro-blog for publishing project updates, and other features.

SourceForge was one of the first to offer this service free of charge to open source projects. Since 2012, the website has run on Apache Allura software. SourceForge offers free access to hosting and tools for developers of free / open-source software.

As of March 2014, the SourceForge repository claimed to host more than 430,000 projects and had more than 3.7 million registered users. The domain sourceforge.net attracted at least 33 million visitors by August 2009 according to a Compete.com survey.

From mid-2013 SourceForge introduced a program called DevShare, which offered projects a way to monetize their downloads by having an optional download that includes prompts for the user to download additional software that is not part of the project. Negative community reactions to the partnership program led to a review of the program, which was nonetheless opened up to all SourceForge projects on February 7, 2014. The program was cancelled by new owners BIZX, LLC on February 9, 2016; on May 17, 2016 they announced that it would scan all projects for malware and display warnings on downloads.
