The recovery image is stored on a dedicated recovery partition on your PC, and is typically 3-6 GB in size. To save space on your PC, you can delete your recovery image from your PC and use a recovery drive instead. If you decide to do this, make sure you don’t lose the USB recovery drive. You’ll need it if you want to refresh or reset your PC in the future.<br />Create the recovery drive<br /><br />Windows 8 and Windows RT include a built-in tool to create a USB recovery drive. Windows will let you know how big the recovery partition is, and you"ll need a USB flash drive at least that big.<br /><br /><b>Warning</b><blockquote>Creating a recovery drive will erase anything already stored on your USB flash drive.
