A custom ROM such as <a href="http://www.catetan.pw/2017/05/13/download-latest-lineage-os-for-android-phones/" >LineageOS</a>, <a href="http://www.catetan.pw/2017/08/09/resurrection-remix-5-8-4-download/" >Resurrection Remix</a>, <a href="http://www.catetan.pw/2017/06/01/how-to-install-paranoid-android-based-on-7-1-2-nougat-on-your-device/" >Paranoid Android</a>, etc. usually doesn’t come with Google apps. There are multiple reasons for that. If it were the contrary, then there would be multiple builds of the same ROM and the build would become heavy. Plus many users get a choice of not to use Gapps with their new ROM and keep it free from Bloatware. Earlier, we have listed Gapps for all the Android version be it Nougat, Marshmallow, Lollipop, KitKat, etc. Recently, Google released official <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/oreo-8-0/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Android 8.0 Oreo </a> update for some of the stunning Pixel and Nexus series phones. Here, download the Google Apps or <strong>Gapps for Android 8.0 Oreo</strong>.</p><p>Gapps are as essential part of the Android operating system. This way, you have all the Google Play services including the official Play Store. It comes for all the devices and all the processor architecture including arm, arm64, x86. So once the <strong>Lineage OS 15</strong> is released based on Android 8.0 Oreo, you will need the latest Gapps to run all the Google services.</p><p>At this moment, Gapps for all the processor architectures have not been developed. Only arm Gapps are available. This is because the AOSP 8.0 Oreo sources are very new and deploying custom ROMS and Google apps for different apps takes a little time. However, you can still flash them on your phone regardless its arm or arm64. Before you do that, boot your phone once immediately after you flash your Android 8.0 Oreo based custom ROM.</p><amp-ad layout="fixed-height" height="300" type="adsense" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8526606076277673" data-ad-slot="1181493937" ></amp-ad><h2>Download Gapps for Android 8.0 Oreo</h2><p><a href="https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=745425885120757579" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" >Gapps for arm devices </a> | <a href="https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=745425885120757579&amp;ez_cid" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Download mirrors</a></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=0By6p5AdQfavBQXl0bUdGSGV5aUE" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" >Gapps for arm64 devices </a> | Downloads available stock</p><p>Gapps for x86 devices | coming soon</p><p>Gapps for x86_64 devices | coming soon</p><p><strong>Read:</strong> <a href="http://www.catetan.pw/2016/02/12/easily-find-processor-architecture-on-android-device-all-cpu-information/" >How to find processor architecture arm, arm65, or x86?</a></p><h3>Download Open Gapps</h3><p>The open gapps are quite popular and trust worthy when it come to custom ROMS.
