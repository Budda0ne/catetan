Recently, I was asked by Oppo A37F owner how to root his phone. So i said to him to root it with the <a href="http://www.catetan.pw/2015/05/kingroot-tool-rooting-untuk-kitkat-lollipop.html">kingroot app</a>. But he said, it can"t be done even with the latest version. So I checked it out myself because i was rooting same devices previously and it worker flawlessly. You can guess the results, it was also fail. I wonder why, so i check the firmware version and found it was updated to newest version.
