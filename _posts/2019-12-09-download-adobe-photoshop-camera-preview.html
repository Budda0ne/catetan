<p>Adobe offers a lot of professional tools to edit images, videos, flash files, and other stuff. Despite offering tons of software to edit the digital content, the company was missing its camera app for smartphones. Well, the company announced its own Adobe Photoshop Camera powered with AI-filters known as “Lens.” The company claims of using its home-built artificial platform Sensei to recognize objects in the photos.</p><p><amp-img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-293904 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-2.jpg" alt="" width="783" height="391" srcset="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-2.jpg 783w, https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-2-696x348.jpg 696w" layout="intrinsic"><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-293904" src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-2.jpg" alt="" width="783" height="391" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></noscript></amp-img></p><p>Apart from the suggestions, the user can manually pick any filter available in the app. It can be applied to images from the media gallery, or the user can preview it in real-time. The “Lens,” aka different filters are divided into categories such as portrait, pop art, cosmic skies, spectrum, food, scenery, etc.</p><p>The interested users can sideload the app as we have got hands-on the apk. After installing the app, it will ask for Adobe, Google, or Facebook account to sign in to the app. The preview app can be used by sideloading and then logging in. It is a preview app, so expect some bugs or can experience lag while using. It is recommended to close the app from recents menu as it can heat-up your device.</p><p><amp-img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-293903 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="//cdn.statically.io/img/www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-1-1.jpg" alt="psc" width="739" height="415" srcset="//cdn.statically.io/img/www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-1-1.jpg 739w, //cdn.statically.io/img/www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-1-1-300x168.jpg 300w, //cdn.statically.io/img/wwwgizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-1-1-696x391.jpg 696w" layout="intrinsic"><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-293903" src="//cdn.statically.io/img/www.gizmochina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-1-1.jpg" alt="psc" width="739" height="415" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px"></noscript></amp-img></p><p>After installation, the user can choose a filter and apply it to the already snapped picture. Otherwise, the app also supports real-time preview of the filter in the viewfinder. Users can spend some time to catch beautiful pictures using the favorite filter through the viewfinder. The globe icon on the top left corner gives you access to the Lens library. It hosts an additional lens, aka filters on the top left corner.</p><p>Apart from the selfie or portrait filters, there’s an abundance of filters to convert typical landscape picture into a high-end image. There are also some funny filters that make you look like a pop artist. The automatic filter suggestions is purely an AI-based feature of the app.</p><p>Adobe Photoshop Camera app is officially compatible with these smartphones. However, it can be installed on other smartphones running Android 9+ onboard.</p><ul><li>Google Pixel3/XL</li><li>Google Pixel4/XL</li><li>Samsung S9/S9+</li><li>Samsung S10/S10+</li><li>Samsung Note 9</li><li>Samsung Note 10/10+</li></ul><p>It is running correctly on devices such as OnePlus 5, 7T Pro, and Huawei Mate 30 Pro.
