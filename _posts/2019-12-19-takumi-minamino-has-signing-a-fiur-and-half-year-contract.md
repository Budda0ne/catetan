Takumi Minamino has revealed what he learned from facing Liverpool after completing a “dream” move to the European champions.

Minamino has signed a four-and-a-half year contract with the Reds having finalised his £7.25million move from Red Bull Salzburg on Thursday.

The Japan international will officially arrive at Anfield when the transfer window opens on January 1.

And Minamino, who will wear the number 18 shirt, admits he never thought he would be capable of playing for the Reds.

“It has been a dream, my dream to become a Liverpool player,” said the 24-year-old, who has 11 goals in 22 appearances for the Japan national team.

“And I’m so excited that the moment has come true.

“To play in the Premier League was one of my targets. I think this is the top-class league in the world; I was thinking if my career as a footballer progressed smoothly, someday I would be able to play in the Premier League.

“But I never thought I would be able to play in this team and I’m really happy about it. I’m looking forward to it.”

Minamino scored 64 goals in 199 appearances for Salzburg having arrived from Cerezo Osaka in January 2015.

One of those strikes came at Anfield earlier this season in the Austrian side's 4-3 Champions League group stage defeat.

The forward, who is eligible to play for his new club in the knockout stages of the competition, was also an impressive performer in the reverse fixture earlier this month when a 2-0 win for Liverpool put them through to the last 16 at Salzburg's expense.

“From those games I learned this team has such a high level of technique and intensity,” said Minamino, speaking to [liverpoolfc.com](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/379061-takumi-minamino-first-liverpool-interview).
