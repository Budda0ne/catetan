Given the response of the host, one can determine which of<br />1) and 2) happened. If we get no response we know that the firewall is<br />blocking us - if we get a response from the server telling us that the port<br />is not open we at least know that it was not filtered by the firewall.<br />Hereby two examples: <br /><br /><code>&gt;telnet wips.sensepost.com 22<br />Trying 160.124.19.98...<br />telnet: connect to address 160.124.19.98: Connection refused<br />telnet: Unable to connect to remote host </code><br /><br />The host responded by telling us that it is not listening on port 22. It<br />also tells us that there is nothing between us and the host (on port 22).<br />So, if we find that for a certain block a number of hosts returns a<br />"connection refused" while other are return a SSH version (port 22 is SSH)<br />we can safely assume that the firewall is configured to allow anyone to<br />connect to port 22 (anywhere in the netblock). Another example<br /><code>&gt;telnet wips.sensepost.com 44<br />Trying 160.124.19.98...<br />telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection timed out </code><br /><br />Here the connection to port 25 is timing out - telling us that there are<br />something blocking the packet to arrive at the final destination. Let us<br />assume that we scan a netblock for port 25 and we find that certain hosts<br />answers with a SMTP greeting, while others simply time out. This tells us<br />that the firewall is configured to only allow packets with a certain<br />destination port on a certain destination IP to enter the network. If we<br />find a "connection refused" answer in a the same net we know that someone<br />probably screwed up - the service is not running, but the config on the<br />firewall has not been updated to close the "hole".  <br /><br />A machine that is dead will respond in the same way as a machine that is<br />protected by a firewall that does not allow anything through. Thus, getting<br />no response from a server does not mean that it is heavily firewalled - it<br />might just be switched off, or unplugged.<br /><br /><b id="dl">Download e-book</b> : <a href="http://adf.ly/JfbUF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mediafire</a> or <a href="http://adf.ly/JffSe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mega</a> mega decription key:Yq0RVkxWXey8oDch42Y9dC49rIAAlvsQ82uysoxaM40<br />
