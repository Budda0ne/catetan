In this post, you’ll learn how to share someone’s Twitter video without having to retweet them and why this is incredibly important.

For example, when you retweet someone, your post typically will look like this:

![retweet post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2025/1*HuNTFsHFONGNyKiuYJjcFQ@2x.jpeg)

Retweeting is fine and is certainly encouraged.

But sometimes, instead of retweeting someone, you should embed their active video in your own Tweet.

Doing this not only makes your post look nicer, but this also gives you the ability to change the text when posting the video.

If you’re not familiar, when you retweet something, you’re unable to change the wording or anything of that Tweet.

**So how do you post a Twitter video without retweeting the original post?**

### Using an iPhone

There’s a very simple way to do this… but you have to be on a mobile device.

Here is how to Tweet someone’s video from another Tweet:

_Step 1:_ Scroll over and view the Tweet/video that you want to embed and post.

_Step 2:_ Tap and hold down on the “play button” for the Tweet’s video

_Step 3:_ Select the “Tweet Video” icon at the bottom of your screen.

You’ll then be given a URL (like what you see below).

Once you compose your message and post the Tweet, you’ll successfully post a video on Twitter (see below) without having to retweet it from someone.

### NEW UPDATE: For Android users

Here’s how to share a video on Twitter without Retweeting if you have an Android phone/non-iPhone:

(There are actually two ways you can do this so be sure to read the second explanation below this one as well)

_Step 1:_ Copy the link to the Tweet you want

_Step 2:_ Paste the link to the tweet and add `/video/1` .. to the end of the Tweet’s URL.

For example, if you wanted to share this Tweet’s video without retweeting it:

![share video tweet](https://miro.medium.com/max/2025/1*yfbE_W0KHHqbO994YBdfSA.jpeg)

You would simply copy the link to the Tweet which is:

`https://twitter.com/GramSpacer/status/1139189232508067841`

And I’d just add **"/video/1"** to the end of the Tweet’s URL like so:

`https://twitter.com/GramSpacer/status/1139189232508067841/video/1`

Once you have the Tweet’s URL with `/video/1` at the end of it, you can paste the new link on Twitter to share a Twitter video without retweeting it like so:

### Another Way

Here’s another way for those that might be interested:

_Step 1:_ Go on a desktop computer

_Step 2:_ Go to the Tweet that has the video you want and click the drop down arrow in the top right hand corner of the Tweet

_Step 3:_ Click “Embed Tweet” (See below)

![embed tweet](https://miro.medium.com/max/2074/1*IoD0SlHt5Bc8wCjXf1oODw.png)

_Step 4: Copy the full text (see below)

![twee embed code](https://miro.medium.com/max/1374/1*-u8fyxCxmfjWK6SASOA0mQ.png)

_Step 4:_ Paste what you just copied in a note or something so you can find the URL you need to copy next.

![video url](https://miro.medium.com/max/2727/1*pq9xy4DpfW3i6tMw4xJG-w.png)

_Step 5:_ From what you just did in Step 4, find and copy the 2nd URL in the text you pasted.

_Step 6:_ Now just compose what you want to say and paste that URL at the end of your Tweet and you’ll successfully share someone’s video on Twitter without having to retweet them — and you don’t have to have an iPhone.
