Though the beta testing for Call of Duty: Mobile in India ended a long time back, we’ve been addicted to the game ever since. It just brought back so many memories. We did have to look for workarounds make the game work in India after the beta ended, but it seems like we won’t need to do that anymore. Call of Duty: Mobile finally has an official release date and it’s October 1.

Call of Duty: Mobile has been officially available in some regions like **Australia** for quite some time now, but it will now be available for all users at the start of the next month. Renowned Call of Duty developer Activision has developed this mobile game closely in partnership with Tencent’s Timi Studio, who also made one of the most popular PUBG Mobile games. It will be **free-to-play** and accessible to both Android and iOS users.

_“We are delivering the definitive, first-person action experience on mobile with signature Call of Duty gameplay in the palms of your hands,”_ stated Chris Plummer, VP, Mobile at Activision, in an official statement. The mobile game hosts some of the most memorable features of the franchise, including maps like Crash and Crossfire from Modern Warfare, and maps like Nuketown and Hijacked from Black Ops, and more.

In addition to the much-loved Team Deathmatch and Free-for-all modes, Call of Duty: Mobile also brings in tow the latest battle royale mode in tow as well. Yeah, if you are someone who has tried Call of Duty’s Blackout mode on PC, well, you will feel right at home. The mobile battle royale mode isn’t the same as the PC game, but the concept remains the same. 100 players drop in an entirely new map — either solo, duos, or in squads — to take down enemies on land, water and even in the air (yes, Call of Duty: Mobile lets you control helicopters). We tested out the Battle Royale mode during beta testing and well, you can read our first impressions right here.

Starting October 1, you will be able to enjoy a PC-like Call of Duty experience on your smartphone itself. The game will become available across the globe, except for China, Vietnam, and Belgium. So, are you excited to go on a killing spree?
