As far as I can tell from a quick teardown and playing around, this is a minor update. All the important changes happened in the previous release, so 4.1.10 is likely a bug fixer. That said, if you see something I missed, please drop a line in the comments.<br /><br />Up# date: 4.1.10 fixes the severe battery-draining location bug introduced in Google Play Services recently, which was especially painful for HTC users. Ron looked into it and found that it downloads a Network Location Provider patch for Google Play Services, though I'm puzzled why Google didn't just update Play Services itself.<br /><br />The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing Play Store. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take weeks, download and install it just like any other APK and enjoy the new Play Store experience.<br /><br /><h2 itemprop="alternativeHeadline">Download com.android.vending-4.1.10.apk</h2>mirror #1 : http://adf.ly/QR7tf 5.8 MB<br />mirror #2 : http://adf.ly/QR8Dx 5.8 MB<br />mirror #3 : <a href="http://q.gs/4QXmr" title="com.android.vending-4.1.10.zip">Mediafire</a> 3.71MB<br />mirror #4 : ---<br /><br />Tutorial: <a href="http://blog.idlohulhaq.com/2013/06/how-to-install-google-play-v4110-apk.html">How To Install Google PLAY v4.1.10 APK On Your Android Device</a>
