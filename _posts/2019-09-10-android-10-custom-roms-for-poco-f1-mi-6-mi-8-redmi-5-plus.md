[Android 10](/tanda/#android-10) and is finally here, and it brings along a lot of goodies that software enthusiasts will appreciate. Officially, stable Android 10 is available on Google Pixel devices, the Essential Phone, and the Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, while beta builds can be found for the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro, and Samsung had been spotted testing the update with OneUI 2.0 for the Snapdragon and Exynos Samsung Galaxy S10 and Exynos Samsung Galaxy Note 10. Source code for the new release is already up and available at AOSP, which brought to us **the first Android 10 custom ROM**, that too on the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 with practically no bugs.

## Some Android 10 custom ROMs are now available

Now, more Android 10 custom ROMs have begun sprouting up for devices like the **Xiaomi POCO F1**, the **Xiaomi Mi 6**, the **Xiaomi Mi 8** and the **Xiaomi Redmi Note 5**.

### Xiaomi Poco F1

The Poco F1 receives unofficial Android 10 courtesy of builds under the Potato Open Sauce Project (POSP) custom ROM. The ROM is not marked as stable, as there appear to be some issues with the fingerprint scanner not working for some users. POSP features are also lacking, but that is alright as we are still in the early days and these features will be migrated over time.

Download **POSP based on Android 10 for the Xiaomi Poco F1**. Link [to forum](https://forum.xda-developers.com/poco-f1/development/rom-posp-v3-0-0-alpha-1-beryllium-t3965821)

### Redmi 5 Plus (Redmi Note 5 India)

Similarly, Android 10-based **POSP** is now available for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (India) / **Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus** (Global). This ROM is marked as an `alpha` build, so we would advise only experienced users try it out at this stage. There are issues with the Goodix-based fingerprint scanner, and issues with the thermal engine â€” stay away if you expect complete daily driver material.

### Xiaomi Mi 6

The **Xiaomi Mi 6** received its taste of Android 10 courtesy of **unofficial LineageOS 17** builds. The only bug listed is for Bluetooth playback, but otherwise, the ROM appears to be in good shape for something that is being based on a new OS version that was launched just last week.

### Xiaomi Mi 8

For the **Xiaomi Mi 8**, you can try out **Pixel3 ROM based on Android 10**. This custom ROM has some **issues with FPC scanners** and Google Camera, but if you can overlook those, you can have your first taste of the latest Android dessert.
