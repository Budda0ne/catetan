Android 10 updates are now underway for several devices, **either officially or unofficially**. The latest version of Android was officially released early this month, and if you have a recent Pixel, OnePlus or Xiaomi device, then you may already be running the **latest and greatest from Google**. If you haven’t yet, then an update may be underway and is set to come to your phone in the near future. Of course, **custom ROMs are also an option**, especially if you have a **relatively older device**. And [custom ROMs based on Android 10] have started to pop up all across xda-developer forums.

## New devices are getting Android 10 ported

Now, the latest devices receiving unofficial Android 10 updates include the **Xiaomi Redmi Note 4**, **Redmi 6 Pro**, the **OnePlus 5**, the **OnePlus 5T**, the **LG V30**, and the **Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e**.

### Xiaomi Redmi Note 4

The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, a budget device from Xiaomi launched in early 2017, also has its dose of Android 10, in the form of **LineageOS 17** as well. There are **issues with the device’s fingerprint sensor** after rebooting, but for the most part, it seems to work well.

Download **LineageOS 17.0 for the Redmi Note 4**. Link [to forum](https://forum.xda-developers.com/redmi-note-4/xiaomi-redmi-note-4-snapdragon-roms-kernels-recoveries--other-development/rom-lineageos-17-0-t3971261)

The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro has **Pixel Experience** builds based on Android 10, and while the developer says that the builds have no known issues, you should still tread carefully.

### OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 5T

The OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T have received **unofficial crDroid 6.0** builds based on **Android 10**. Some users are reporting **issues with Bluetooth** as well as **issues with the fingerprint scanner** in the case of the OP5T, but apparently your mileage may vary.

### LG V30

There is also an unofficial LG V30 build of **LineageOS 17**. It’s considered as an `alpha` by the developer, though, and there are a **fair few bugs that may break your overall experience**.

Download **LineageOS 17.0 for the LG V30**. Link [to forum](https://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-v30/development/rom-lineageos-15-1-t3789793)

### Galaxy Tab S5e

The Galaxy Tab S5e, one of Samsung’s **most recent tablets**, has received an unofficial build of **LineageOS 17.0**, which seems to be **bugless** (at least for the most part).

Download LineageOS 17.0 for the Galaxy Tab S5e. Link [to forum](https://forum.xda-developers.com/tab-s5e/development/rom-lineageos-17-0-t3972371)

While these rom builds are available to be downloaded, you should **treat them as experimental builds**, given how Android 10 has only been out for some weeks.
