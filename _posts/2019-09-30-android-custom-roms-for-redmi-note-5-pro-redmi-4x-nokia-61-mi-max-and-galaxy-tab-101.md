Android 10 was officially rolled out on September 3rd and was instantly available for the Pixel devices, the Essential Phone PH-1, and the Redmi K20 Pro. OnePlus followed the suit and rolled out the Android 10 update for OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro. Making up for the smartphones that have not or are not likely to receive the Android 10 update anytime, the Android development community has thrived hard to create Android 10-based AOSP or Custom ROMs for a long list of devices. 

## Android 10 available for 5 more devices

Now, **five more devices have been added** to this list and these include the Xiaomi **Redmi Note 5 Pro (India)**, **Redmi 4X**, first-gen **Mi Max**, Samsung **Galaxy Tab A 10.1** (2016), and the **Nokia 6.1**.

### Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro

**AOSP Extended** brings enhancements with improvement over the pure stock experience for better user experience. This build supports Redmi Note 5 Pro, one of the most popular devices in the Redmi Note lineup. Due to its popularity in India, the **Note 5 Pro** has been one of the earliest devices to get new features like a dark mode but an official Android 10 update is yet to be confirmed. This ROM is currently in **beta and may have some bugs** in terms of usability.

### Xiaomi Redmi 4X

**PixyxOS for Redmi 4X** based on AOSP, PixysOS developers have selectively chosen some of the great features from other custom ROMs along with some of their own customizations on the top. The Xiaomi Redmi 4X is a two-year-old smartphone with entry-level hardware and is likely to make it to Xiaomi’s intended list of devices for official Android 10 update. The **current build is in beta** and Goodix fingerprint scanner does not work as of now but if you want a taste of Android 10, you can still give it a try.

### Xiaomi Mi Max/Max Pro

It's Unofficial **LineageOS 17** for Xiaomi **Mi Max/Max Pro**. The Mi Max was launched in 2016 as a more affordable alternative to the Mi Note devices. If you’ve been wanting to jump the stock Android bandwagon, the unofficial LineageOS 17 ROM could be a reliable gateway. This build **supports both** the Mi Max and the Mi Max Pro variants. The current build is in beta and may **have some UI glitches**, as per the developer.

### Samsung Galaxy Tab A Series

Again, Unofficial LineageOS 17 for Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2016). Launched more than three years ago, the 2016 **Samsung Tab A 10.1** has not even received an official Android Pie update. But if you’ve meaning to try the improved material theme or features like a system-wide dark theme, you can grab the **unofficial LineageOS 17** for **both** the cellular and the Wi-Fi-only variants of the tablet. Do note that the developer of the ROM reports **bugs related to RIL** (Radio Interface Layer) and there might be **some connectivity errors**.

### Nokia 6.1

**AOSP Extended** for Nokia 6.1. The OG Nokia 6.1 is part of the Android One program and this guarantees incremental Android updates **until the next year**. As per HMD Global’s roadmap, the Nokia 6.1 **will get an official Android 10** update in Q1 next year. But you can cherish the newer Android 10 features right away with the AOSP Extended ROM for the smartphone.
