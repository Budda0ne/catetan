<em rel="keywords">Squid Efficiency Analyzer</em> - open a log file and start analysis. Wait for the results which are shown in an table (detailled view) and in a text field (summary). You may then export the results to a file.<br /><noscript><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VBL2EL0oLB8/UZ7SQSjnnfI/AAAAAAAAEgo/lUimbAcs9UA/s1600/SquidEff.JPG" title="SquidEff.JPG"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VBL2EL0oLB8/UZ7SQSjnnfI/AAAAAAAAEgo/lUimbAcs9UA/s640/SquidEff.JPG" alt="SquidEff.JPG"/></a></noscript><em rel="keywords">Squideff</em> checks every line of the Squid log file and assigns occurrence and traffic to the different cache codes. Afterwards, traffic from cache and internet are calculated.<br /><br /><strong>Squid Efficiency Analyzer Report Explanation:</strong><br /><br />Theese codes are provided as being <b>data coming from the cache</b>:<br /><ul><li>TCP_HIT</li><li>TCP_REFRESH_HIT</li><li>TCP_REF_FAIL_HIT</li><li>TCP_IMS_HIT</li><li>TCP_MEM_HIT</li><li>TCP_OFFLINE_HIT</li><li>UDP_HIT</li></ul>The following codes are calculated as <b>data coming from the internet</b>:<br /><ul><li>TCP_MISS</li><li>TCP_REFRESH_MISS</li><li>TCP_CLIENT_REFRESH_MISS</li><li>TCP_SWAPFAIL_MISS</li><li>UDP_MISS</li></ul>The rest is shown as <b>not considered for efficiency</b>: <br /><ul><li>TCP_NEGATIVE_HIT</li><li>TCP_DENIED</li><li>UDP_DENIED</li><li>UDP_INVALID</li><li>UDP_MISS_NOFETCH</li><li>NONE</li></ul><br />For an <b>explanation from the report</b> of the codes see below.<br /><b>##Cache Result Codes##</b><br />TCP_HIT<br />A valid copy of the requested object was in the cache.<br /><br />TCP_MEM_HIT<br />A valid copy of the requested object was in the cache, AND it was in <br />memory so it did not have to be read from disk.<br /><br />TCP_NEGATIVE_HIT<br />The request was for a negatively-cached object. Negative-caching refers <br />to caching certain types of errors, such as "404 Not Found." The amount <br />of time these errors are cached is controlled with the negative_ttl <br />configuration parameter.<br /><br />TCP_MISS<br />The requested object was not in the cache.<br /><br />TCP_REFRESH_HIT<br />The object was in the cache, but STALE. An If-Modified-Since request was <br />made and a "304 Not Modified" reply was received.<br /><br />TCP_REF_FAIL_HIT<br />The object was in the cache, but STALE. The request to validate the object <br />failed, so the old (stale) object was returned.<br /><br />TCP_REFRESH_MISS<br />The object was in the cache, but STALE. An If-Modified-Since request was <br />made and the reply contained new content.<br /><br />TCP_CLIENT_REFRESH<br />The client issued a request with the "no-cache" pragma.<br /><br />TCP_IMS_HIT<br />The client issued an If-Modified-Since request and the object was in the <br />cache and still fresh.<br /><br />TCP_IMS_MISS<br />The client issued an If-Modified-Since request for a stale object.<br /><br />TCP_SWAPFAIL<br />The object was believed to be in the cache, but could not be accessed.<br /><br />TCP_DENIED<br />Access was denied for this request<br /><br />UDP_HIT<br />A valid copy of the requested object was in the cache.<br /><br />UDP_HIT_OBJ<br />Same as UDP_HIT, but the object data was small enough to be sent in the UDP <br />reply packet. Saves the following TCP request.<br /><br />UDP_MISS<br />The requested object was not in the cache.<br /><br />UDP_DENIED<br />Access was denied for this request.<br /><br />UDP_INVALID<br />An invalid request was received.<br /><br />UDP_RELOADING<br />The ICP request was "refused" because the cache is busy reloading its metadata.<br /><br /><h2 itemprop="alternativeHeadline">Download Squid Efficiency Analyzer</h2><br /><a href="http://adf.ly/PSUOc">squideff.zip</a> - 349.07 KB
