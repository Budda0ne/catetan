**Liverpool’s FA Cup replay against Shrewsbury to take place days after Southampton clash.** Liverpool take on League One minnows Shrewsbury Town in a FA Cup fourth-round replay on Tuesday, February 4 at 19:45 (_5 Januari 2020 02:45 dini hari_ WIB). The Reds threw away a two-goal lead against the Shrews at Montgomery Waters Meadow in the first leg to set up a replay at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp is expected to snub managing the Reds for the match.

## Line-up

**Neil Critchley could hand three more Liverpool youngsters their first-team debut as he leads the under-23s into the FA Cup replay against Shrewsbury.**

The young Reds are back in senior action this week as Jurgen Klopp is once again forced to delegate his duties as the result of scheduling issues.

Unlike in December, when their involvement at the Club World Cup required Liverpool to miss the League Cup quarter-final at Aston Villa, Klopp and his players are not obligated to be elsewhere this time around.

But the manager has taken the decision to skip this replay and instead “respect” the winter break, perhaps rightly so given its intention.

This leaves Critchley will a difficult task against a League One side that drew 2-2 with the Reds at New Meadow last time out, though less difficult than the trip to Villa Park.

### New Faces

Isaac Christie-Davies and Herbie Kane, who both featured against Villa, have since left the club on loan, which opens up the prospect of a full debut for **Leighton Clarkson**.

Reportase: Pemain Shrewsburry sakit hati karena goal semata wayangnya dianulir wasit karena offside. Akibatnya mereka gantung diri pada menit 75. Pemain era millenial memang begitu; "Gak perlu main tangan, bully saja teroos, nanti juga kalo gak kuat bakalan bunuh diri."
