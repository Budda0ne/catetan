The Reds [won the Champions League for a sixth](/sepakbola/tradisi-lama-liverpool-kembali-setelah-berhasil-juara-liga-champions/) time in June, extending their record as the English team with the most wins in the competition. As a result, several of [Jurgen Klopp’s squad](/sepakbola/liverpool-5-tahun-mendatang-tanpa-salah-mane-dan-van-dijk/) have received a ratings hike from last year.

FIFA 20's full release date is September 27, 2019.

Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah is the joint-highest-rated Liverpool player in the game with an overall rating of 90. The 27-year-old, who was rated 88 last season, comes complete with 93 pace and 89 for dribbling, while he’ll promise the find the net regularly with 86 shooting.

Up there with Salah at the top of Liverpool's ratings is Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk, who is also a 90-rated player. The centre-back, who is heavily in contention for the Ballon d’Or later this year, is the **highest-rated defender in the game**.

The other two members of Liverpool’s devastating front three - Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino - are both rated in the high eighties. Senegalese winger Mané has seen his rating improve to 88, up two points from last year, while Firmino’s overall rating has stayed the same at 86.

Brazilian goalkeeper Alisson has an 89 rating in this year’s game, which includes 90 positioning, 89 reflexes and 85 for his kicking.

Liverpool’s full-backs have also received a **massive improvement** on their ratings. Last year, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson were rated at 78 and 81 respectively; now the former has shot up to 83, with his Scottish team-mate a little higher at 85 – enough to put him in the game's top 100 players. 

Exciting young forward Rhian Brewster has a 64 rating, while [summer signing Sepp van den Berg](/sepakbola/liverpool-making-unknown-youngster-first-signing/) comes in at 66.
