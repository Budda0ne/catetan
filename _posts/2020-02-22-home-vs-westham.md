### Kit (jersey) rumour

{% include figure image_path="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/NikeKit1994.jpg" caption="" %}

Footy Headlines have provided an example of the colour scheme on their Instagram, which shows how the white-and-teal cuffs could look alongside the traditional red:

This could be inspired by the home shirts Liverpool wore in 1993/94 and 1994/95, which saw white detailing over the Adidas shirt and a teal/green edging to the collars and cuffs.

It is safe to say Nike would produce a decidedly more ‘modern’ design, with Footy Headlines speculating that it could be similar to the recently leaked Barcelona and Tottenham shirts for next season, with an overlapping V-neck collar.

This remains purely speculation, with Liverpool and Nike unable to unveil their new-look kits until the deal with New Balance ends on June 1.
{:.notice .notice--warning}

Previous information has suggested the away kit will be ‘hyper turqoise’, which could be similar to the shirt from 1992/93, while the third kit is expected to be “dark grey, most likely with a subtle black checker pattern, and pinkish red logos.”

### Last Match Note

A Diego Simeone [tactical wrinkle](/liverpool/ucl-away-vs-atletico/) could provide Premier League managers **the key to slowing down Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool**.

Simeone showed another way: commit wholesale to stopping the counter. And while you have to get lucky to actually score from the corner (which Atlético did) you're still in a primary position to deliver a second ball.

The Atlético manager built a protective band of four players packed outside of the box, with only four players actually in the box waiting to receive the ball

{% include figure caption="Atletico's set piece wich was lead to a early goal." image_path="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article17787525.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Atletico-Madrid-corner-set-up.png" url="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article17787525.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_Atletico-Madrid-corner-set-up.png" %}

Premier League managers **will likely** look to Atletico's second set-up. The pre-corner look was the same, four players spread outside of the box

{% include figure caption="Atleti had the same set up for their second corner." image_path="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article17787613.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Atleti-second-corner.png" url="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article17787613.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_Atleti-second-corner.png" %}

Atletico knocked the ball short and then whipped a cross into the box from deep, with the four attacking players inside the box running onto the ball at pace, while two of the defensive screeners still sat some way from Liverpool's defensive block.

With one cross, four Liverpool defenders were essentially eliminated from the defensive portion. And as Allison gathered the tepid cross and looked to initiate a fast-break the screeners at the edge of the box were able to shift into position in order to press the passer and to cut off his supply line.

Jürgen Klopp has turned what should be a moment of defensive worry — defending a corner — into a way to attack. But Diego Simeone might have provided other managers the blueprint to slow it down.

### Game Ahead: West Ham

Losing the captain is a blow, but it should help offer Jürgen Klopp [some midfield](#starting-xi-prediction) clarity.

{% include figure image_path="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article17791625.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1201884415.jpg" url="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article17791625.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_GettyImages-1201884415.jpg" caption="Henderson is expected to miss up to a month with a hamstring injury." %}

Jordan Henderson's injury solves a problem for Jürgen Klopp, but gives three different choices now. 

## Line Up

Alisson is immovable between the sticks, having impressed yet again despite defeat, while Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson are settled as first-choice defence.

The form of Gomez—another standout in Madrid—in particular has come to the detriment of Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren, who will likely tussle for a single place on the bench again.

In midfield, Fabinho is near-guaranteed to start as the No. 6, while Gini Wijnaldum should keep his place in the three-man unit, too.

## Starting XI Prediction

With Henderson dropping out, Keita provides the most interesting option to step into the advanced role, fending off competition from Oxlade-Chamberlain, Milner and Lallana, against a meek West Ham side.

This leaves Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino to start in attack, with no issues with Mane’s fitness, having been brought off at half-time in midweek due to the risk of a red card:

{% include figure image_path="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/Lineup1WestHam.jpg" caption="First option: Alisson; Trent, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Keita; Salah, Mane, Firmino" %}

Oxlade-Chamberlain or Origi would be considered alongside Mane, Firmino and Salah the striker, but it may be time to pull the trigger on Minamino.

It has been almost two months since the 25-year-old’s arrival, and though this would be ahead of the three-month time frame for Fabinho‘s first league start, there would arguably be less of a risk with an attacker.

If Minamino does start, Liverpool could line up like this:

{% include figure image_path="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/Lineup2WestHam.jpg" caption="Alternative: Alisson; Trent, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Minamino, Firmino, Mane; Salah" %}

### Confirmed

Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Keita, Wijnaldum; Salah, Mane, Firmino

Substitutes: Adrian, Lovren, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Minamino, Lallana, Origi, Matip.
