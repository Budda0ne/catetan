Southampton striker Danny Ings ahead of the forward returning to Anfield on Saturday. As he was on loan from the Reds last season, Ings was ineligible for face Klopp's side, but now the move has become permanent, he will line up against his former club for the first time on Merseyside.

Ings, who scored against the Reds earlier in the campaign, was linked with Manchester United in some quarters earlier today after an incredible campaign with Saints, for whom he has netted 14 times in 24 matches in the Premier League.

**Liverpool's FA Cup replay against Shrewsbury to take place days after Southampton clash**
Liverpool take on League One minnows Shrewsbury Town in a [FA Cup fourth-round replay](/liverpool/fa-cup-home-vs-shrewsburry/) on Tuesday, February 4. The Reds [threw away a two-goal lead against the Shrews](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/fa-cup-away-vs-shrewsbury/) at Montgomery Waters Meadow in the first leg to set up a replay at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp is expected to snub managing the Reds for the match. _Reports via [Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpools-fa-cup-replay-against-21386539)_

## Line Up

Klopp revealed that **Adam Lallana** and **Divock Origi** should be available for the game with Southampton, though **Xherdan Shaqiri** and **James Milner** will miss out.

Divock Origi is fit for Liverpoolâ€™s Premier League clash with Southampton this weekend, Jurgen Klopp has confirmed. Origi did well on the left-hand side [against West Ham](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/away-vs-westham/), winning the penalty that Mohamed Salah converted.

With Oxlade-Chamberlain retained alongside Henderson and Wijnaldum, Minamino could join the front line to give the Reds an attacking bent, with four pouring forward more often than not.

[Takumi Minamino](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/takumi-minamino-has-signing-a-four-and-half-year-contract/) is a more gifted player, but as the [narrow win at Wolves](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/away-vs-wolves/) showed, he lacks the speed to stretch opposition defences and spring counter-attacks in wide areas.

There is the prospect of **Oxlade-Chamberlain** then moving into attack, as he did late on against the Hammers, but instead Klopp could hand **Takumi Minamino** his first league start on the left is also an option..

## Match

Livestream will be available 5 minutes before the kick-off.
