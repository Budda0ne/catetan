Southampton striker Danny Ings ahead of the forward returning to Anfield on Saturday. As he was on loan from the Reds last season, Ings was ineligible for face Klopp’s side, but now [the move has become permanent](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/dijilati-kuntilanak-diludahi-pocong/), he will line up against his former club for the first time on Merseyside.

[Ings, who scored against the Reds earlier](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/361212-southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report) in the campaign, was linked with Manchester United in some quarters earlier today after an incredible campaign with Saints, for whom he has netted 14 times in 24 matches in the Premier League.

## Line Up

{% include video provider="youtube" id="1TwaxMtWfcs" %}

Klopp revealed that **Adam Lallana** and **Divock Origi** should be available for the game with Southampton, though **Xherdan Shaqiri** and **James Milner** will miss out.

Divock Origi is fit for Liverpool’s Premier League clash with Southampton this weekend, Jurgen Klopp [has confirmed](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/385053-liverpool-southampton-team-news). Origi did well on the left-hand side [against West Ham](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/away-vs-westham/), winning the penalty that Mohamed Salah converted.

With **Oxlade-Chamberlain** retained alongside **Henderson** and **Wijnaldum**, Minamino could join the front line to give the Reds an attacking bent, with four pouring forward more often than not.

There is the prospect of **Oxlade-Chamberlain** then moving into attack, as he did late on against the Hammers, but instead Klopp could hand **Takumi Minamino** his first league start on the left is also an option.

[Takumi Minamino](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/takumi-minamino-has-signing-a-four-and-half-year-contract/) is a more gifted player, but as the [narrow win at Wolves](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/away-vs-wolves/) showed, he lacks the speed to stretch opposition defences and spring counter-attacks in wide areas.

### Confirmed line-up

{% include figure image_path="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/squad-5-10.jpg" caption="Confirmed Line-up via ThisIsAnfield" %}

**Liverpool:** Alisson; Trent, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Henderson, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Oxlade-Chamberlain

**Substitutes:** Adrian, Matip, Lovren, Keita, Lallana, Jones, Origi

**Southampton:** McCarthy, Ward-Prowse, Stephens, Bednarek, Bertrand, Djenepo, Romeu, Hojbjerg, Redmond, Long, Ings

**Substitutes:** Gunn, Danso, Vestegaard, Smallbone, Boufal, Obafemi, Adams

## Match: Firmino the assist King and Ox in the box

Liverpool’s final Premier League game before the ‘winter break’ ended in a thumping 4-0 win over Southampton, though the victory wasn’t earned without struggles.

It's seven goals for the season now for Ox—in 17 starts, a quite formidable strike rate considering he has played precisely one entire 90-minute match.

Our two forward members on the day, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, absolutely ruled the game in the second half, with the latter providing three of the four assists." %}

The No. 1 was as perfectly in position on every occasion as the duo ahead of him usually are in defence, smothering a few through passes, taking high balls and making a couple of saves, too.

**Goals:** Oxlade-Chamberlain 47’, Henderson 60’, Salah 71’, 89’

22 points clear of Manchester City with a victory, before Pep Guardiola’s men take on Tottenham on Sunday.
