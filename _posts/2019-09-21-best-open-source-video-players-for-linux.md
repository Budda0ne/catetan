Wondering which video player should you use on Linux? Here’s a list of top open source video players available for Linux distributions.

You can watch **Hulu**, **Prime Video** and/or **Netflix** on Linux. You can also download videos from YouTube and watch them later or if you are in a country where you cannot get **Netflix** and other streaming services, you may have to rely on torrent services like **Popcorn Time** in Linux.

Watching movies/TV series or other video contents on computers is not an ‘ancient tradition’ yet. Usually, you go with the default video player that comes baked in with your Linux distribution (that could be anything).

You won’t have an issue utilizing the default player – however, if you specifically want more open-source video player choices (or alternatives to the default one), you should keep reading.

It included the installation steps for Ubuntu but that shouldn’t make it the list of Ubuntu video players. These open source software should be available in any Linux distribution you are using.

**Installing the software**
Another note for [Ubuntu](/linux/ubuntu-19-10-will-boot-faster-with-lz4-compression/) users. You should have **universe repository** enabled in order to find and install these video players from the software center or by using command line. I have mentioned the commands but if you like, you can also install them from the Software Center.

Please keep in mind that the list is in no particular order of ranking.

### 1. VLC Media Player

![Vlc Media Player](https://i0.wp.com/itsfoss.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/vlc-media-player.jpg)

Key Highlights:
- Built-in codecs
- Customization options
- Cross-platform
- Every video file format supported
- Extensions available for added functionalities

VLC Media Player is unquestionably the most popular open source video player. Not just limited to Linux – but it’s a must-have video player for every platform (including Windows).

It is a quite powerful video player capable of handling a variety of file formats and codecs. You can customize the look of it by using skins and enhance the functionalities with the help of certain extensions. Other features like subtitle synchronization, audio/video filters, etc, exist as well.

[VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/){:.btn .btn--large .btn--info}

#### How to install VLC?

You can easily install VLC in Ubuntu from the Software Center or download it from the official website.

If you’re utilizing the terminal, you will have to separately install the components as per your requirements by following the [official resource](https://wiki.videolan.org/Debian/#Debian). To install the player, just type in:

`sudo apt install vlc`

### 2. MPlayer

![MPlayer playing video from terminal](https://i1.wp.com/itsfoss.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/mplayer-video.jpg)

Key Highlights:
- Wide range of output drivers supported
- Major file formats supported
- Cross-platform
- Command-line based

Yet another impressive open-source video player (technically, a video player engine). MPlayer may not offer you an intuitive user experience but it supports a wide range of output drivers and subtitle files.

Unlike others, MPlayer does not offer a working GUI (it has one, but it doesn’t work as expected). So, you will have to utilize the terminal in order to play a video. Even though this isn’t a popular choice – it works and a couple of video players that I’ll be listing below are inspired (or based) from MPlayer but with a GUI.

If you want to know about SMPlayer a bit more – we have a separate article here: SMPlayer in Linux.

Similar to VLC, it also comes baked in with codecs, so you don’t have to worry about finding codecs and installing them to make it work unless there’s something specific you need.

### Wrapping Up

We would recommend you to try out these open source video players over anything else. In addition to all these, you can also try [Miro Player](http://www.getmiro.com/) which is no more being actively maintained but works – so you can give it a try, if nothing else works for you.

However, if you think we missed one of your favorite Linux video player that deserves a mentioned, let us know about it in the comments down below!
