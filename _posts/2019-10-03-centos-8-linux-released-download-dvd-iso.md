[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) is a free and open-source, community-driven Linux distribution based on the popular security-focused Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It was designed to be consistent rolling-release distro joined with Red Hat but still independent from RHEL as it has its autonomous governing board. Awesome stuff.

### What’s New in CentsOS 8?

As you probably know, **CentsOS 8 is a clone of RHEL 8** so it benefits from its latest features:

- Cockpit web console is available by default in CentOS 8.
- Support for up to 4PB of physical memory.
- Nginx 1.14 is now available in the core repository.
- PHP version 7.2 is the default PHP version.
- Python 3.6 is the default Python version.
- Wayland is the default display server.
- nftables has replaced iptables to be the default network filtering framework.
- XFS now has support for shared copy-on-write data extents.
- RPM 4.14 (as distributed in RHEL 8) validates package content before installing.
- A new version of YUM based on DNF which is compatible with YUM 3 (as is in CentOS 8).
- Content is channeled through 2 main repos: BaseOS and Application Stream (AppStream).
- The brand new CentOS Stream

### BaseOS and Application Stream (AppStream)

CentOS 8 content is distributed via the 2 main repositories: **BaseOS** and **AppStream**.

#### BaseOS

Content in the **BaseOS repository** is available in the RPM format and it is intended to deliver the main set of the underlying OS functionality that gives the base for all installations.

#### AppStream

Content in the **AppStream repository** is available in two formats – the famous RPM format and an extension to the RPM format called modules, which comes with additional user space apps, runtime languages and databases in support of the diverse workloads and use cases.

**IMPORTANT:** Both **BaseOS** and **AppStream** content repositories are required for a basic CentOS installation.

### What is the CentOS Stream?

> The new CentOS Stream is a rolling-release distro that tracks just ahead of **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** (_RHEL_) development, positioned as a midstream between **Fedora Linux** and **RHEL**. For anyone interested in participating and collaborating in the RHEL ecosystem, **CentOS Stream** is your reliable platform for innovation

### Other Updates

- The CentOS team have dropped support for KDE.
- CentOS no longer has the Btrfs file system with the arrival of version 8.
- Deprecated Network scripts.
You can see all the security functionality that has been removed from CentOS 8 as well as other deprecated functionality [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.0_release_notes/rhel-8_0_0_release#deprecated_functionality) and [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_8/security_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-8#removed_security_functionality) respectively.
