## Heads up

FYI, di game week 18 LFC absen, dan MU kena gasak Watford üòÖ. Sepertinya [mitos baru](https://www.catetan.pw/sepakbola/tren-korban-liverpool-balaskan-dendam-ke-lawan-selanjutnya/) ini memang benar...

Manchester membenamkan Leicester City dengan skor 3-1. Artinya, klasemen tidak banyak berubah. Liverpool tetap di _putjuk_ dengan raihan 49 poin dari 17 laga dan disusul Leicester yang tetap mengantongi 39 poi dari 18 laga. Sementara Mancester City mulai menyusul dengan tambahan 3 poin dan bercokol di posisi ke-3 klasemen sementara liga inggris.

"No news on anyone else, which is good news," he added.

"Matip, Lovren, and Fabinho (are) in a good way but not ready for these games."

**Leicester City v Liverpool is go ...**
1 min: Liverpool get the ball rolling, their players wearing red shirts, shorts and socks. The players of Leicester wear their customary home strip of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks.

**GOAL! Leicester City 0-1 Liverpool (Firmino 31)**
Roberto Firmino heads Liverpool into the lead, leaping highest at the far post to convert a wonderful cross from assist-merchant Trent Alexander-Arnold. His downward header sneaks in at the bottom corner.

**Half-time: Leicester 0-1 Liverpool**
Peep! The teams go in for the break with Liverpool leading courtesy of Roberto Firmino‚Äôs downward header after he leapt to get on the end of Trent Alexander-Arnold‚Äôs long diagonal cross. Liverpool have spurned several easier chances, with Sadio Mane and Mo Salah both guilty of uncharacteristically sloppy efforts to finish.

**GOAL! Leicester 0-2 Liverpool (Milner 71pen)**
Liverpool double their lead, with James Milner scoring with his first kick of the ball. Schemiechel dived to his left, but Milner slotted the ball low and down the middle.

**GOAL! Leicester 0-3 Liverpool (Roberto Firmino 75)**
Yet another assist from Alexander-Arnold, who has been outstanding tonight. He drills a low cross into the penalty area and it‚Äôs converted by Roberto Firmino, who fires into the top corner.

**GOAL! Leicester 0-4 Liverpool (Alexander-Arnold 78)**
Now Alexander-Arnold gets on the scoresheet, firing into the bottom left-hand corner from distance, with a fine first-time shot after being teed up by Sadio Mane. He let the ball roll across his body onto his left foot and could scarcely have struck a sweeter shot.

**Full time: Leicester City 0-4 Liverpool**
Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It‚Äôs all over at the King Power Stadium, where Liverpool have cruised to victory with an imperious performance. Trent Alexander-Arnold was the stand-out performer, providing two assists, winning his side a penalty and getting amongst the goals as his side romped to victory. Liverpool are 13 points clear of second placed Leicester in the race for the title and have a game in hand on their closest rivals.

## After-match

**Man of the Match: Trent Alexander-Arnold speaks.**

‚ÄúWe played really good football, especially after all the travelling we‚Äôve had to do.,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSo I suppose in that context it was one of our best performances of the season. To score four goals in a place like this is never easy.‚Äù

On his goal: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get on the scoresheet too often and I thought, yeah, just hit it first time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt really think you‚Äôre going to be in this position but we‚Äôre not going to take anything for granted and just keep going,‚Äù he says, when asked about Liverpool‚Äôs 13-point lead at the top of the table. 

Alongside him, James Milner concurs, saying it‚Äôs only halfway through the season and ‚Äúanything can happen‚Äù.
