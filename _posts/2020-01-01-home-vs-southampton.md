Southampton striker Danny Ings ahead of the forward returning to Anfield on Saturday. As he was on loan from the Reds last season, Ings was ineligible for face Klopp's side, but now the move has become permanent, he will line up against his former club for the first time on Merseyside.

Ings, who scored against the Reds earlier in the campaign, was linked with Manchester United in some quarters earlier today after an incredible campaign with Saints, for whom he has netted 14 times in 24 matches in the Premier League.

## Line Up

Klopp revealed that Adam Lallana and Divock Origi should be available for the game with Southampton, though Xherdan Shaqiri and James Milner will miss out.

Divock Origi is fit for Liverpoolâ€™s Premier League clash with Southampton this weekend, Jurgen Klopp has confirmed. Origi did well on the left-hand side [against West Ham](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/away-vs-westham/), winning the penalty that Mohamed Salah converted.

[Takumi Minamino](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/takumi-minamino-has-signing-a-four-and-half-year-contract/) is a more gifted player, but as the [narrow win at Wolves](https://www.catetan.pw/liverpool/away-vs-wolves/) showed, he lacks the speed to stretch opposition defences and spring counter-attacks in wide areas.

## Match

Livestream will be available 5 minutes before the kick-off.
