This new release comes with quite a few new features and enhancements resolving some performance and device compatibility issues. The direct download link to Flash Player 15 offline installers is available at the end of this article. First we’ll look into some of the new features included in this release.<br /><br /><b>New Updates and features</b><br /><br /><b>Stage3D standard profile available for iOS and Android</b><br /><br />In Flash Player 14, the Stage3D standard profile was only available in the Desktop versions. From version 15, it will be available in iOS and Android making advanced 3D features available in those mobile platforms. I’m not sure why Windows Phone was not supported.<br /><br /><b>Improved support for browser zoom levels</b><br /><br />In the previous versions of Flash Player, the player would cause problems if Internet Explorer in Windows 8 was zoomed in to more than 100%. This was problematic especially for people who are using Microsoft Surface tablets. But with Flash Player 15, zooming problem has been fixed. No more crashes due to zoom-in or zoom-out.<br /><br /><b>Full Screen orientation change</b><br /><br />Most smart devices, nowadays, automatically adjust the orientation of the video or photo if we change the angle of the smart device. For example, if we are running a video on Windows Phone or Android or iOS and change the angle 90 degrees, the video will automatically get adjusted according to the current orientation of the device. Now Flash Player 15 can also detect the device orientation automatically and adjust to it.<br /><br />If you want to go through all the technical changes in this release of Flash Player, you may want to read Flash Player 15/Adobe Air 15 release notes.<br /><br /><b>System Requirements</b><br /><br />First of all, if you are a Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 user, this release is not for you. Windows 8 comes with its own version of Flash Player which is updated through Windows Update. If you have Windows Update enabled, Flash Player 15 will be installed on your system when a stable version is released.<br /><br />Browser requirements include Internet Explorer 8 or above, Firefox 17 or above, Google Chrome and Opera 11.<br /><br />Operating Systems supported include Windows XP through Windows 8 both 32-bit and 64-bit versions including Windows Server editions.<br /><br /><strong id="download">Download Section</strong><br /><br /><b>Download links</b><br /><br /><br />Adobe Flash Player 15 can be downloaded from the following direct download links.
