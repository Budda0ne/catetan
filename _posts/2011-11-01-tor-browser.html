<b>Tor Browser (Anonimity Browser Bundle)</b><br /><u>Description</u><br /><span style="color: red;"><br />[notation release from torproject.org]</span><br />Bundle  The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications  around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the  world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from  learning what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit from  learning your physical location, and it lets you access sites which are  blocked.  The Tor Browser Bundle lets you use Tor on Windows, Mac OS X,  or Linux without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB  flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser, and is  self-contained. The Tor IM Browser Bundle additionally allows instant  messaging and chat over Tor. If you would prefer to use your existing  web browser, install Tor permanently, or if you don't use Windows, see  the other ways to download Tor.
